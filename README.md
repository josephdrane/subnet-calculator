# Subnet Calculator

View the App here : [https://subnet.help](https://subnet.help)

## WHAT?

A react driven single page app (spa).
The app provides a way to do IP v4 subnet calculation (IP v6 in the future? maybe!).
The calculation is done in javascript (and probably could be optimised) as well could provide more meaningful information.

## WHY?

I wanted to recreate this site from before where I used Python (Flask) and Javascript that only ran in the browser.
New deployment options available to host the site.
I want to take over as the defacto subnet calculator out there!
